# DiffAD: Diffusion Model for Antigen Distance Prediction

## Overview
DiffAD is a novel diffusion-based model designed for predicting antigenic distances in influenza viruses. Our approach leverages receptor binding site (RBS) constraints and learnable attention mechanisms to achieve superior performance in antigenic distance prediction tasks.
